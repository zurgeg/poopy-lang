# poopy-lang
## Basic syntax
### Strings
Strings are simply represented by ```'```s and are used in ```view``` statments, which I'll get to later.

### Variables
You can assign a variable just like in Python: ```name = value```. You can also use ```name >>``` which gets the value of a variable.

### View statments
The ```view``` statement is used just like Python 2's ```print``` keyword. Do ```view 'hello'```.

### If statments
The only current statement supported is the ```if value => othervalue:``` which is **if** value is **equal to** (=>) other value return True. Otherwise, return False

### Expressions
The only thing missing from the expression system is ** (to the power of) and // (sqrt). Those won't be that hard to implement and will most likely be thrown into 1.1 or 1.2. You can do complex and simple expressions.

### Functions
**W.I.P**

### Modules
**W.I.p** (Arriving in probably 1.1 or 1.2 if exp ** and // are coming with)
